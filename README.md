##Assignment 1 
This dataset comes from a previous behavioral study conducted in my lab. Each row represents one participant and they experienced either a win or a loss during a videogame round. Following the loss their preference for switching to a different video game was measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
I am interested in understanding how winner and loser effects influence different adaptive behaviors such as switching or playing the same game again. Specifically whether participants are more likely to switch strategies after experiencing a loss compared to after a win. This question relates to broader biological and behavioral theories of perseverance, winner–loser effects, and adaptive responses to failure.
For this assignment, I used this existing dataset to practice data handling and analysis techniques while framing and translating a biological question into a statistical comparison of switching behavior following wins versus losses.

For this assignment I used, StackOverflow to get tips on using ifelse statements and chi square tests, and then streamlined my understanding on them using ChatGPT.
